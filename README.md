# To use this repository on your computer
1. Install Lean 4 and VS Code following
   these [instructions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).
2. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
3. Let's say you want to use the `copilot` lean project.
4. `cd copilot`.
5. `lake exe cache get`.
6. Use VS Code to open the `copilot` folder (not its subfolder or parent foler).

At that point, you can open the textbook in a side panel in VS Code as follows:

1. Type `ctrl-shift-P` (`command-shift-P` in macOS).
2. Type `Lean 4: Docview: Open Docview` in the bar that appears, and then
  press return. (You can press return to select it as soon as it is highlighted
  in the menu.)
